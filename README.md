# ESPN-Transaction-Notification
Sends email with ESPN transactions of the day 

The idea for this project was that the ESPN app had lacked several features, with one being the inability to see what type of players your leaguemates were bidding on. This project allows users visibility into the type of bids that went into the day's transactions. This is more useful in an FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget) format, as it allows you to see who was bid on and for how much, revealing how much another owner(s) wanted that player.
